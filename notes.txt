Important Considerations:
1. üîí Firewall / Network Configuration
Ensure that the server machine's port 8001 is open on its firewall.

If running on localhost (localhost), it won't be accessible from another device. Use the local LAN IP address (like 192.168.x.x).

2. üîê CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
If your frontend and backend run on different origins (e.g., ports or IPs), the backend must allow CORS.

In FastAPI, add this to your main.py:


from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],  # You can restrict this in production
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
) 


Redis (short for REmote DIctionary Server) is an in-memory database, cache, and message broker.
It's super fast and often used to store temporary data like:

API rate limits

Session data

Caches for database queries

Background task queues

Real-time counters
